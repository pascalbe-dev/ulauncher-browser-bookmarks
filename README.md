# ulauncher-browser-bookmarks

> [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) Extension to quickly open browser bookmarks.

❗ This extension is heavily based on [this extension](https://github.com/nortmas/chrome-bookmarks). It's published as separate extension, because the original extension is hardly maintained anymore. Special thanks to Dmitry Antonenko for developing the original extension 👏
